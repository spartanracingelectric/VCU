 * pid.c - Proportional-Integral-Derivative (PID) controller
 * Initial Author: Harleen Sandhu / Mehul Williams
 ******************************************************************************
 * General purpose PID controller, initially designed for Torque Vectoring.
 * 
 * The PID controller works by using three terms to calculate an output value that is used to control a system. The three terms are:
 * Proportional: This term is proportional to the error between the target and current values. It is multiplied by a constant gain value (Kp) that determines how much the controller responds to changes in the error.
 * Integral: This term is proportional to the running sum of errors over time. It is multiplied by a constant gain value (Ki) that determines how much the controller responds to steady-state errors.
 * Derivative: This term is proportional to the rate of change of the error. It is multiplied by a constant gain value (Kd) that determines how much the controller responds to changes in the rate of change of the error.
 * By adjusting the values of the three gain constants (Kp, Ki, and Kd), the controller can be tuned to respond differently to changes in the error, steady-state errors, and changes in the rate of change of the error.
 * Generally, higher values of Kp will lead to faster response to changes in the error, while higher values of Ki will lead to faster response to steady-state errors, and higher values of Kd will lead to faster response to changes in the rate of change of the error.
 * Conversion between SlipR and Torque -> Kp
 * Proportional test first with other output 0, get midway with target and then tune other items. There are many factors of noise.
 * Kp will give you the difference between 0.1 current vs 0.2 target -> if you want to apply 50nm if your error is 0.1 then you need 500 for Kp to get target
