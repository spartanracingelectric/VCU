 The PID controller works by using three terms to calculate an output value that is used to control a system. The three terms are:
Proportional: This term is proportional to the error between the target and current values. It is multiplied by a constant gain value (kp) that determines how much the controller responds to changes in the error.
Integral: This term is proportional to the running sum of errors over time. It is multiplied by a constant gain value (ki) that determines how much the controller responds to steady-state errors.
Derivative: This term is proportional to the rate of change of the error. It is multiplied by a constant gain value (kd) that determines how much the controller responds to changes in the rate of change of the error.
By adjusting the values of the three gain constants (kp, ki, and kd), the controller can be tuned to respond differently to changes in the error, steady-state errors, and changes in the rate of change of the error.
Generally, higher values of kp will lead to faster response to changes in the error, while higher values of ki will lead to faster response to steady-state errors, and higher values of kd will lead to faster response to changes in the rate of change of the error.
Conversion between SlipR and Torque -> kp
Proportional test first with other output 0, get midway with target and then tune other items. There are many factors of noise.
Kp will give you the difference between 0.1 current vs 0.2 target -> if you want to apply 50nm if your error is 0.1 then you need 500 for kp to get target
